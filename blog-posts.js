            <p><strong>First draft</strong><br>
            I didn't know I was going to write a novel when I joined the online writing community The Novelry. Perhaps a memoir, perhaps some short stories. Then suddenly, a story blossomed. A plot. Characters. And I became possessed.</p>

            <p>Writing the first draft took me three months, and was magical. I'd wake each morning between 4am to 5pm, stretch and meditate, and write at least 1,000 words, stopping at a point where I was just hungry enough for a little more, but not satisfying that hunger, so the next morning I'd be excited to go again.</p>

            <p>I also kept a writing log, where I wrote how many words that day, a summary of what I wrote, and a summary of what I thought I needed to write next. After three months, I had this nice chart of number of words.</p>

            <p>After writing the first draft, I took three months off and relaxed and read, just getting some distance from what I had written.</p>

            <p><strong>Second draft</strong><br>
            For the next draft, I realized my process had to be different, but wasn't sure how. There wasn't a uniform process, and I struggled a bit. I needed structure and knew that writing and revising the second draft would be messy. Here's what I decided to do:</p>

            <p>Each day I had a spreadsheet where I would write what I planned on writing, what I actually wrote, and what I planned on writing next. I used Airtable for this, as I found it was an amazing tool to use for everything related to my process, from organizing my characters, scenes, and plot, ideas, among other details (I'd used this for the first draft too).</p>

            <p>Sometimes I needed a space for bigger thinking or more rambly thinking, so for this I used Dropbox Paper, and always kept my Moleskine notebook close at hand.</p>

            <p>After draft two, I sent the novel to a Dominic Wakeford, a fantastic freelance editor in London, who sent me back super helpful feedback and gave me confidence to move forward.</p>

            <p><strong>Third draft</strong><br>
            I corrected all of this editor's feedback which took me about a month, cutting about 10,000 words of needless dialogue, then sent it to Lily Lindon at The Novelry for their Ultimate Manuscript Assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Fourth draft</strong><br>
            I received super helpful feedback from Lily. All writing is subjective, so when you send it out to different editors they're going to focus on different things. You must know your writing, know the story you are trying to tell, so you don't get tripped up or swayed into directions that don't feel true.</p>

            <p>The next draft took me about two months, reviewing Lily's feedback and focusing on different aspects. I restructured things, rewrote the second chapter, cut about 10,000 words, and added another 10,000.</p>

            <img src="images/ticino.webp" alt="Ticino" class="post-image">
            <p class="image-caption">Took a week-long holiday to Ticino and edited</p>

            <p><strong>Fifth draft</strong><br>
            Put a special focus on different ideas in the story, made them more nuanced and real. Then, had a Big Edit session with Lily on the first three chapters.</p>

            <p><strong>Sixth draft</strong><br>
            Read through the novel and fine-tuned it. Sent it to Lizzy, the Editorial Director at The Novelry, and she approved it to move forward. With The Novelry's help, we sent the query and synopsis to ten agents.</p>

            <p>I got lots of initial interest, received two full MS requests, but no one bit.</p>

            <p><strong>Seventh draft</strong><br>
            Did another read-through, correcting things I felt could be improved. You know those nagging things with your novel you just know aren't right? Yeah? Well, fix those before sending the novel to agents. You'll feel better about your work.</p>

            <p>I then submitted the novel to another ten agents. No one bit.</p>

            <p><strong>Eighth draft</strong><br>
            Sent my query letter and first three chapters to another editor. She returned most of my money, because she thought the novel was already there.</p>

            <p>Now, I am taking a break from sending it out, mostly because I am deep into my new novel and putting all of my focus there. In total, I've sent the novel out to twenty one agents, and either get declines or no responses. Once I'm at a good draft stage with this new novel, I'll start sending this first novel out again.</p>

            <p>❤️</p>

            <p>"People first, then money, then things," Suze Orman used to say on her television show. This is a phrase I kept repeating to myself when I booked a flight for my mom to come to Europe. After the flights, train tickets, hotel bookings, and upcoming dinner reservations, I couldn't help thinking: "This is going to be expensive. I am not used to spending money like this."</p>

            <p>Don't get me wrong. I have a good salary, I can afford it. But the poor college student won't leave, who still yells at me for spending over $40 on a book. But as soon as my mom came - this worrying about the cost almost completely disappeared.</p>

            <p>Because she was here, in my home, at my work, in my Roman neighborhood. She was here, on the Venice canals, in Paris. I watched her every moment, looking at her eyes, watching her dazzled at what she was seeing.</p>

            <p>Like a small child, she took it all in. Like a sponge, learning about the world. She was discovering.</p>

            <p>"What a gift!" I thought. "What an awesome gift!" To give her the chance to see a part of the world she never would have otherwise.</p>

            <p>My mom lives in the Midwest. After working at the same company for 27 years, she recently went back to school and became a nurse at 54 years old. Now she spends her work weeks from 7pm to 7am in one of the most dangerous parts of the city, taking care of the poor and minorities; people who've lived very hard lives.</p>

            <p>Of course, my mom and I have a complicated relationship. She gave birth to a boy who would one day carve out his very own life - make his own choices, struggle to become who he really was. At a young age I rejected a lot of what was handed me by the world I was born into. Rejected the "default" sexuality that was not my own, the predetermined religion that was not my own, the city where I didn't belong.</p>

            <p>But my mom and I are bounded. By simply love - she's my mom. So, to take her to Zürich, Lucerne, Rome, Venice, and Paris. Small drops in the bucket of a rich life that she gave me so readily, so lovingly and happily. A mom is a mom is a mom is a mom - I can never pay her back for what she's given.</p>

            <p>And I am still thinking about her face, her expression as we went to Colosseum or took a boat through the Venice canals or walked under the shade of the Eiffel Tower. The wonder in her eyes; an immeasurable gift.</p>

            <p>I turned around as soon as he started mooning a group of schoolchildren.</p>

            <p>I couldn't take it. Daniel was just too much to handle. I began walking ahead of him, increasing the distance between us. But two minutes later, he jumped on me in hysterical fits. "No, no — don't be angry! Please! I love you." Typical Daniel. One moment doing something completely egregious. The next, confessing his love and affection for you.</p>

            <p>For every bad thing Daniel did, there was an equal amount of love, kindness, generosity, and affection he gave to everyone he knew. He would do anything and everything to make his friends happy, giving all he had and asking for nothing in return.</p>

            <p>It pains me to write this in the past tense, but maybe someday this will become normal: his heart stopped beating on January 23, 2012, 23:29 Holland time. His death is impossible to accept, like an unfathomable reality I cannot comprehend.</p>

            <p>When I discovered his heart would stop beating at any moment, I first went to the gym. It seemed like the only thing to do. "Just follow the schedule, Matti. Follow the damn schedule," I told myself. And I did. I went to the gym and began running. But I had to stop. I couldn't continue. It was as if someone or something was placing a white sheet over everything — all of the treadmills, weights, exercise machines, and my own ability to think. I had to do something else, but I didn't know what to do — my best friend was dying.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Crazy. Lovable. Intense. Genuine. Impulsive. Creative. Attention-seeking. Sweet. There's so many ways to describe Daniel.</p>

            <p>We first met at a bar in Amsterdam called Prik. Daniel approached me because he thought I was 17 years old. After later discovering I was in fact 26, Daniel said: "The bar must have been very dark." Shortly after meeting, Daniel introduced me to the rest of his friends. All of his friends were normal, unlike him. What a surprise! They didn't sit on strangers' laps, sing a show tune loudly at a random moment, or order four bottles of wine without having any money. His friends were level-headed and responsible.</p>

            <p>We were all fascinated by his energy — an enormous ball of spectacular energy that made you his audience by virtue of proximity to him. Even at 5 am, after a long night of dancing and drinking — he would be bouncing off the walls while the rest of us could barely open our droopy eyes.</p>

            <p>Most of Daniel's life was an adventure in which every moment was seized.</p>

            <p>On his 33rd (and last) birthday, Daniel smashed my face into his birthday cake. I grabbed a handful of cake and Daniel began running. I caught up to him in the next room and spread the white frosting in his hair like it was hair gel. The night before his birthday, Daniel took his glass of red wine and poured it over a friend's head. On another friend's white couch.</p>

            <p>However, Daniel was not always causing trouble. He was one of the sweetest and the most intimate persons I have ever met — always hugging me, holding my hand, and wanting to cuddle on the couch. Intimacy was extremely important for Daniel, and whether you liked it or not you were going to be continually touched while he was around you.</p>

            <p>Daniel's level of intimacy made me initially uncomfortable, most likely because my dad is a former Marine. I was raised to believe intimacy between two male friends is socially unacceptable. However, Daniel forced me to become more intimate, as he did with the rest of his friends. How I appreciated those hugs! Those kisses! Those moments we had snuggling on the couch! How I would do anything to have those intimate moments again!</p>

            <p>But it is not to be. He is now dead.</p>

            <p>He had an epileptic attack on January 20th. I knew Daniel had had epilepsy. Vaguely. He must have told me he had it at some point or another. But I never thought an epileptic attack would kill him — cause him to not breathe and have a heart attack, and make him brain dead.</p>

            <p>Daniel was a friend who danced, sung, twirled you around and around in circles, and told random people your dick size (or his best estimate of your dick size). Daniel detested boredom and mediocrity, and was focused solely on doing what he wanted.</p>

            <p>"It's Daniel's world," we used to say. "We just live in it."</p>

            <p>For many, like me, giving Daniel the spotlight was no problem. I loved his crazy personality and his infectious zest for life. For others, he caused a visceral reaction that had the person looking for the nearest exit away from him. "Daniel is Daniel," we used to say.</p>

            <p>Now we try to say: "Daniel was Daniel."</p>

            <p>The night after Daniel died, I had a dream that he suddenly woke up in his hospital bed and said, "I was just kidding guys! The joke is on you!" After I woke up, I broke down crying because I realized it was a dream. I actually expected Daniel to do this, because it would be so typical for Daniel to do.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, I daydream that Daniel is going to come around the corner, and begin laughing at me like I am a complete idiot for thinking he was dead. Daniel's seismic personality makes it unbelievable that he really is gone, forever.</p>

            <p>He was not ready to die. Daniel was taken with his soul shrieking: "No no no no no no no!" Now everyone who loved him is crying: "No no no no no no no!" His death has been too much to handle, and all who love and loved him are coming to grips with a reality that is impossible to swallow.</p>

            <p>A beautiful and raucous life, taken from us. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no…</p>
